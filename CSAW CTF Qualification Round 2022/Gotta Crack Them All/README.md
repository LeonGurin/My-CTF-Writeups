# Gotta Crack Them All

**xxx points**

As an intern in the security department, you want to show the admin what a major security issue there is by having all passwords being from a wordlist (even if it is one the admin created) as well as potential issues with stream ciphers. Here's the list of encrypted passwords (including the admin's), the encryption algorithm and your password. Can you crack them all and get the admin's password? Here is the web service that the admin made to encrypt a password: nc crypto.chal.csaw.io 5002

NOTE: The flag is just the admin's password.

*Given:* [encrypt.py](https://github.com/LeonGurin/CSAW-CTF-Qualification-Round-2022/blob/main/Gotta%20Crack%20Them%20All/encrypt.py) [leaked_password.txt](https://github.com/LeonGurin/CSAW-CTF-Qualification-Round-2022/blob/main/Gotta%20Crack%20Them%20All/leaked_password.txt) [encrypted_passwords.txt](https://github.com/LeonGurin/CSAW-CTF-Qualification-Round-2022/blob/main/Gotta%20Crack%20Them%20All/encrypted_passwords.txt)

Looking into the python script we can understand that the way they encrypted the passwords is a normal letter by letter xor cipher with a key.

So using the `netcat` provided I checked the encrypted version of the leaked password:

```
>> Cacturne-Grass-Dark
The encrypted password is: b'kz\xc6\xb9\xd9Du\xcb\x8a\x9e\xe0\x9d\xbeo\xee\x03\xcf\xddd'
```

and so I made a code to xor each letter with of `Cacturne-Grass-Dark` to get the encrypted letter.

```python
enc = b'kz\xc6\xb9\xd9Du\xcb\x8a\x9e\xe0\x9d\xbeo\xee\x03\xcf\xddd'

with open('leaked_password.txt','r') as f:
    pas = f.read()

i = 0
j = 0
key = b''
while j < len(enc):
    if (ord(pas[j]) ^ i).to_bytes(1,'big') == enc[j].to_bytes(1,'big'):
        key += i.to_bytes(1,'big')
        j += 1
        i = 0
    else:
        i += 1

print(f"the key is {key}")
```

and the output was the key: 

`the key is b'(\x1b\xa5\xcd\xac6\x1b\xae\xa7\xd9\x92\xfc\xcd\x1c\xc3G\xae\xaf\x0f'`

I then added a script to decrypt each password with this key:

```python
with open('encrypted_passwords.txt', 'rb') as f:
    enc = f.read().splitlines()

def encrypt(plain):
	return b''.join((ord(x) ^ y).to_bytes(1,'big') for (x,y) in zip(plain,key))

dec = ''
for e in enc:
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = 0
    while j < len(e):
        if k == len(key):
            k = 0
        if (i ^ key[k]).to_bytes(1,'big') == e[j].to_bytes(1,'big'):
            dec += chr(i)
            j += 1
            k += 1
            i = 0
        else:
            i += 1
    print(dec)
    dec = ''
```

and I got the following output:

```

as you can see, some of the passwords that were longer than the leaked password had weird characters that were not right.

I noticed while looking at the passwords the password: `Mr. Mime-Psychic-FaÃ”Ã¥g` and realized that the passwords were pokemon and their types!

I grabbed the longest password I could find `Hakamo-o-Dragon-FigÃ•Ã£wj0` and checked online what "Hakamo-o"s types are. And, not surprisingly, the password is supposed to be:

`Hakamo-o-Dragon-Fighting`

And so I entered it in the netcat script and got the encryption, found the key with the same code I wrote in the beginning and decrypted all of the passwords again.

```python
# enc = b'kz\xc6\xb9\xd9Du\xcb\x8a\x9e\xe0\x9d\xbeo\xee\x03\xcf\xddd'

# with open('leaked_password.txt','r') as f:
#     pas = f.read()
enc = b'`z\xce\xac\xc1Y6\xc1\x8a\x9d\xe0\x9d\xaas\xadj\xe8\xc6h\xfd\xf8\xd2\xa7\x9c'
pas = 'Hakamo-o-Dragon-Fighting'

i = 0
j = 0
key = b''
while j < len(enc):
    if (ord(pas[j]) ^ i).to_bytes(1,'big') == enc[j].to_bytes(1,'big'):
        key += i.to_bytes(1,'big')
        j += 1
        i = 0
    else:
        i += 1

print(f"the key is {key}")

with open('encrypted_passwords.txt', 'rb') as f:
    enc = f.read().splitlines()

def encrypt(plain):
	return b''.join((ord(x) ^ y).to_bytes(1,'big') for (x,y) in zip(plain,key))

dec = ''
for e in enc:
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = 0
    while j < len(e):
        if k == len(key):
            k = 0
        if (i ^ key[k]).to_bytes(1,'big') == e[j].to_bytes(1,'big'):
            dec += chr(i)
            j += 1
            k += 1
            i = 0
        else:
            i += 1
    print(dec)
    dec = ''
```

and my output was:

```
the key is b'(\x1b\xa5\xcd\xac6\x1b\xae\xa7\xd9\x92\xfc\xcd\x1c\xc3G\xae\xaf\x0f\x95\x8c\xbb\xc9\xfb'

and then we notice the only non pokemon and type password which is the admins password and the key:
