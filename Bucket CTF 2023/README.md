And more, some challenges instances got shut down before we could finish writing the writeups for them.

We made a team writeup for the challenges we solved, you can find it [here](https://void-11.gitbook.io/_voidctf-write-ups/)!

I solved the challenges: Random Security and Transmission (and helped with other challenges).
