*Note:* This challenge launches an instance on demand.

___

The program asks us to provide 2 integers that would satisfy the equation:

`n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2 `

and in the code if we enter the branch:

```cpp
else if (addIntOvf(sum, num1, num2) == -1)
```

we will not exit the program (unlike the first one) and in order to finally get the flag we need to ensure that `num1 > 0 || num2 > 0`.

We can overflow the sum with 2 positive integers to satisfy all the conditions, so entering: `1073741824, 1073741824` we can get the flag:
