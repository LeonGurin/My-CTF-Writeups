Description
How about some hide and seek heh?
Look at this image [here](https://github.com/LeonGurin/picoCTF-2023/blob/main/Cryptography/HideToSee/atbash.jpg).

The worst challenge in this competition.

Just put the file into [https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html)

and it will magically give you the flag in `atbash` decode it with `decode.fr` and get the flag.

This challenge was `guess the website we did to extract the flag` and this was branded as a cryptography challenge. So misleading.
