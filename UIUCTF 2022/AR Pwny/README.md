Entering the website prompts you to scan the `QR code` and clicking a button.

This button is only present using a phone and displays the big 3 model using AR with your camera.

Upscaling the model in this AR view with your fingers on the phone and entering the texture you can see that the inside of the model is not filled and 2 QR codes are hidden within the model:

Screenshoting the codes and scanning afterwards gives you 2 texts which when combined, gets the following code:
