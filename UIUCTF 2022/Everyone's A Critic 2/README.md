**Everyone's A Critic 2 - 50 points**

There is a video game reviews content creator who has somehow ended up reviewing UIUCTF, make sure their reviews are not too harsh by investigating them!. Can you find their YouTube channel and discover their list of good games?

Searching `chuck.lephucke` in google gets us to his youtube channel where there are 2 videos.

The catch is that we have to click the playlist and not the video without it, because inspecting the playlist description reveals the flag:

So the flag is:
> uiuctf{m@ke_sUrE_2_j01n_mY_ch@nn3L}
