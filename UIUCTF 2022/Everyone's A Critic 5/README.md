**Everyone's A Critic 5 - 50 points**

There is a video game reviews content creator who has somehow ended up reviewing UIUCTF, make sure their reviews are not too harsh by investigating them!. Can you find Chuck's actual Steam account to see what games he has been playing?

Again searching the username `chuck.lephucke` on steam got the right user.

Looking in the reviews tab we can find a review of `CS:GO` with the CTF flag:
