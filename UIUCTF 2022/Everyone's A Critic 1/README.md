**Everyone's A Critic 1 - 50 points**

There is a video game reviews content creator who has somehow ended up reviewing UIUCTF, make sure their reviews are not too harsh by investigating them!. Start by finding them on the UIUCTF Discord!

Searching the word `review` in the discord search bar, we find that an acount with a purple name shows up that claims to be said reviewr, clicking on his name and looking at his role we can get the flag:

To be honest, the way I got the flag during the competition was by looking at the other osint challenges and on Everyone's A Critic 5 its stated that `Can you find Chuck's actual Steam account` and so I searched `Chuck` and got the same answer.
