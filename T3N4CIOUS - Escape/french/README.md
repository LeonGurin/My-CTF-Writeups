French Ciper

V3Y4GK0FW{EccrEsXpvtjIcdc}

___

Typing `french cipher` in google literally just gave me as the first result the `VigenÃ¨re ciphe`.

Using that I tried plugging the string into different calculators but they all struggled with the numbers.

And so I used [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher) to decode and I entered the key manually trying to get each letter right for the `T3N4CI0US` flag template. 

Thankfully the key was really short and the manual work was pretty easy I got the flag:

> T3N4CI0US{CrypTo_Verry_Easy}

_Note:_ I had to manually add the underscores because when looking at the discord annoucements the flag was written as:

`V3Y4GK0FW{EccrEs_Xpvtj_Icdc}`

pretty sure that if they acrually fixed the mistake in the prompt more people would get it.
