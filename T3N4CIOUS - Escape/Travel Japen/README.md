**Was not solved by me, but was solved by my teammate**

This challenge was a nightmare.

The picture is just a picture of an outlet.

Using reverse image search on the picture we know most of the info we need, its an outlet and its from japan (we could guess that also because of the title)

Because of the format (that was clarified mid competition) we know that we need to find the type of this outlet.

Googling japanese outlets lets us know that they use type A and B outlets with the only difference between the 2 is that A doesn't ground.

This is it, we solved the challenge but for the rest of the time remaining we could not know how to submit the answer with the format given.

In the end the answer found by my teammate at 2:30 AM like 4 and a half hours before the end of the competition was:

>T3N4CIOUS{A_outlet}

What

Frick.
